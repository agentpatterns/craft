# Craft Implement: Workflow Details

This reference provides detailed templates, examples, and procedures for executing the task-graph-driven implementation workflow across all three tracker modes (YAKS, BEADS, NATIVE).

## Agent Dispatch

Each task contains a self-contained agent task description in its context. The craft orchestrator reads the context via the tracker-specific command and uses it to build the agent prompt. No plan file reading is needed.

### Building Agent Prompts

For each ready task (from readiness computation), read the task context using the appropriate tracker command:

#### YAKS

```bash
yx context "{task name}"
```

#### BEADS

```
Skill: beads:show {issue-id}
```

Reads agent context from the issue description.

#### NATIVE

```
TaskGet: { id: "{task-id}" }
```

Reads agent context from the description field.

---

After reading the context:

1. The context follows the self-contained format from `/draft` (see draft template.md)
2. Dispatch via `Task` tool using the registered agent type matching the task's `agent-type` field
3. The agent receives the task context as its prompt — its system prompt is defined in the plugin's `agents/` directory

### Agent Dispatch Table

| agent-type Field | Agent Type (subagent_type) | Purpose |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------|
| `agent-test` | `crafter:agent-test` | Write failing tests (RED gate) |
| `agent-impl` | `crafter:agent-impl` | Minimal implementation + YAGNI check (GREEN gate) |
| `agent-validate` | `crafter:agent-validate` | Run full test suite, report only (VALIDATE gate) |
| `no-test` | `crafter:agent-no-test` | Non-TDD tasks (schema, infrastructure) |
| `agent-remediate` | `crafter:agent-remediate` | Fix implementation after validation failures |

### Dispatch Format

For each agent dispatch, pass the task context as the prompt:

```
Task(
  description="P{N}: {Phase} — {agent role}",
  subagent_type="crafter:agent-test",  // or agent-impl, agent-validate, etc.
  prompt="{task_context}"
)
```

The registered agents have their own system prompts defining role, rules, and report format. The task context provides the task-specific context (file paths, test specs, gates, constraints).

See `plugins/crafter/agents/` for the full agent definitions:
- `agent-test.md` — RED gate: writes failing tests only
- `agent-impl.md` — GREEN gate: minimal implementation + YAGNI simplification pass
- `agent-validate.md` — VALIDATE gate: runs full suite, reports only, never fixes
- `agent-no-test.md` — Non-TDD tasks (schema, config, infrastructure). After completing the task, the agent should verify that any markdown links in modified files point to existing files.
- `agent-remediate.md` — Fixes implementation after validation failures (uses opus)

---

## Readiness Computation Algorithm

The craft skill computes readiness from the task list. In YAKS and NATIVE modes, this is an in-skill computation (see algorithm below). In BEADS mode, `Skill: beads:ready` returns the ready set directly.

### YAKS

Use `yx list --format json` to fetch the epic tree, then apply the algorithm:

```python
# Pseudocode — applies to YAKS mode
def compute_ready(epic_json):
    phase_groups = epic_json["children"]  # top-level children of the epic

    # 1. Extract prefix number from name (e.g., "P2-Core-Logic" → 2)
    for group in phase_groups:
        group["prefix"] = int(re.match(r"P(\d+)", group["name"]).group(1))

    # 2. Group by prefix number
    by_prefix = defaultdict(list)
    for group in phase_groups:
        by_prefix[group["prefix"]].append(group)

    # 3. Find active groups (all lower-prefix groups done)
    ready = []
    for prefix in sorted(by_prefix.keys()):
        # Check all lower-prefix groups are done
        all_lower_done = all(
            g["state"] == "done"
            for p in by_prefix if p < prefix
            for g in by_prefix[p]
        )
        if not all_lower_done:
            break  # This prefix and all higher are blocked

        for group in by_prefix[prefix]:
            if group["state"] == "done":
                continue
            if not group["children"]:
                # Leaf phase group — the group itself is the task
                ready.append(group)
            else:
                # Parent phase group — find first non-done child
                for child in sorted(group["children"], key=lambda c: c["name"]):
                    if child["state"] != "done":
                        ready.append(child)
                        break

    return ready
```

### BEADS

```
Skill: beads:ready
```

Returns the unblocked tasks directly — no in-skill computation needed.

### NATIVE

Use `TaskList` to fetch all tasks, then apply the same naming-convention algorithm as YAKS: extract the `P{N}` prefix from each task title, group by prefix, and return the first non-done tasks at the lowest incomplete prefix level. Parse `TaskList` output instead of yaks JSON.

### Example Walk-Through

Given this task tree:
```
Epic: "Add Discount Codes"
  P1-Schema-Setup         [done]
  P2-Core-Logic           [wip]
    01-write-tests        [done]
    02-implement          [done]
    03-validate           [todo]    ← READY
  P2-Feature-B            [todo]
    01-write-tests        [todo]    ← READY (P2 group independent)
  P3-Repository           [todo]        (blocked — P2 not done)
```

Ready tasks: `P2-Core-Logic/03-validate` AND `P2-Feature-B/01-write-tests` — dispatched in parallel.

---

## Parallel Dispatch

When readiness computation returns multiple tasks, dispatch them all in a **single message** with multiple `Task` tool calls.

### When Parallel Dispatch Occurs

- Two phase groups share the same prefix number (e.g., P2-Feature-A and P2-Feature-B)
- Multiple leaf phase groups are active simultaneously
- A no-test phase and a test-write phase are both ready

### When NOT to Parallelize

- Within a TDD triplet: Write Tests → Implement → Validate MUST be sequential
- Agent 2 needs Agent 1's test files on disk before it can run
- Agent 3 needs Agent 2's implementation on disk before it can run

### Example: Parallel Dispatch

If readiness returns `P1-Schema-Setup` (leaf, no-test) and `P1-Config-Setup` (leaf, no-test):

```
# Single message with two Task calls:
Task(description="P1: Schema Setup", subagent_type="crafter:agent-no-test", prompt="...")
Task(description="P1: Config Setup", subagent_type="crafter:agent-no-test", prompt="...")
```

## Remediation Task Creation

When Agent 3 (Validate) reports failures, create new tasks under the same phase group parent to handle remediation. The procedure is the same across all tracker modes — only the commands differ.

### Procedure

1. **Create remediation task** (name: `04-remediate-attempt-{M}`, agent-type: `agent-remediate`):

   #### YAKS

   ```bash
   yx add "04-remediate-attempt-1" --under "P2-Core-Logic" --field "agent-type=agent-remediate"
   echo "{remediation context}" | yx context "04-remediate-attempt-1"
   ```

   #### BEADS

   ```
   Skill: beads:create "04-remediate-attempt-1"
   ```

   Set parent to `P2-Core-Logic` and include the `agent-type=agent-remediate` field. Then:

   ```
   Skill: beads:dep "04-remediate-attempt-1" depends-on "03-validate"
   ```

   #### NATIVE

   ```
   TaskCreate: { title: "04-remediate-attempt-1", description: "{remediation context}" }
   ```

   Include the full remediation context (failure output, files to fix, instructions) in the description field.

2. **Create re-validation task** (name: `05-revalidate-attempt-{M}`, agent-type: `agent-validate`):

   #### YAKS

   ```bash
   yx add "05-revalidate-attempt-1" --under "P2-Core-Logic" --field "agent-type=agent-validate"
   echo "{revalidation context}" | yx context "05-revalidate-attempt-1"
   ```

   #### BEADS

   ```
   Skill: beads:create "05-revalidate-attempt-1"
   Skill: beads:dep "05-revalidate-attempt-1" depends-on "04-remediate-attempt-1"
   ```

   #### NATIVE

   ```
   TaskCreate: { title: "05-revalidate-attempt-1", description: "{revalidation context}" }
   ```

3. **Mark the original validate task as done** — it completed its job (reporting failures):

   #### YAKS

   ```bash
   yx done "03-validate"
   ```

   #### BEADS

   ```
   Skill: beads:close "03-validate"
   ```

   #### NATIVE

   ```
   TaskUpdate: { id: "{task-id}", status: "completed" }
   ```

4. The sequential naming (`04-`, `05-`) ensures remediation runs next, then re-validation

### Remediation Task Context Template

```markdown
## Agent Task: Remediate — {Phase Name} (attempt {M})

**Role:** Fix the implementation to make all tests pass. Do NOT modify test files.

### Agent Context
- **Files to modify (implementation):** `{implementation file path(s)}`
- **Files to read (tests, DO NOT MODIFY):** `{test file path(s)}`
- **Full test command:** `{full test suite command}`
- **Failure output from validation:**

{paste Agent 3's failure output here}

### Instructions
1. Read the failing tests to understand expected behavior
2. Read the implementation files to find the issue
3. Fix the implementation — minimal changes only
4. Run the full test suite
5. Verify ALL tests pass

### Report
- Files modified: [list paths]
- What was fixed: [brief description]
- Test command output: [paste]
- Result: ALL PASS or STILL FAILING
```

### Escalation

If attempt count reaches 2 and re-validation still fails:
1. Report the failure to the user with full context
2. Wait for user guidance before proceeding

---

## Progress Reporting

### After Each Task Completes

Report the completion and overall epic progress:

```markdown
**Done:** P2-Core-Logic / 01-write-tests
**Next:** P2-Core-Logic / 02-implement (now ready)

**Epic Progress:** 3/12 tasks done
```

### Periodic Summary

Fetch the full task list using the tracker list command and show the full epic status:

#### YAKS

```bash
yx list
```

#### BEADS

```
Skill: beads:list --epic "{id}"
```

#### NATIVE

```
TaskList
```

Parse the titles to reconstruct phase/task hierarchy and report status.

---

Render the summary in this format regardless of tracker:

```markdown
**Progress Update:**
- [done] P1-Schema-Setup
- [done] P2-Core-Logic / 01-write-tests
- [done] P2-Core-Logic / 02-implement
- [wip]  P2-Core-Logic / 03-validate (dispatched)
- [todo] P3-Repository-Layer (waiting for P2)
- [todo] P4-Apply-Discount / 01-write-tests (waiting for P3)
- [todo] P4-Apply-Discount / 02-implement
- [todo] P4-Apply-Discount / 03-validate

**Progress:** 3/8 tasks done (37%)
```

---

## Error Handling Procedures

### If Agent 1 RED Gate Fails

If tests pass immediately (before implementation):
1. **STOP** — the test is not testing new behavior
2. **Do NOT mark the task as done** — leave it
3. **Report to user** — explain that tests pass without implementation
4. **Do NOT dispatch Agent 2** — the phase is broken

### If Phase Cannot Be Completed

If a phase cannot be completed after remediation:
1. **Report to user** with full failure context
2. **Ask for guidance** — should we adjust the approach?
3. **Don't skip ahead** — the naming convention prevents this (lower numbers must complete first)

### If Tracker State is Inconsistent

If readiness computation returns no tasks but non-done tasks remain:
1. Fetch the full task tree (tracker list command with JSON/verbose output)
2. Look for phase groups where all children are done but the parent isn't
3. Mark completed parents as done using the tracker's close/done command
4. Report to user with details

---

## Session Recovery

### YAKS

No special recovery logic needed:

1. User runs `/craft` in a new session
2. Identify the epic (user provides name or check `yx list`)
3. Compute readiness from `yx list --format json` — returns exactly the next dispatchable tasks
4. Resume the orchestration loop from Step 2

Done tasks represent completed work (files already on disk). The orchestration loop picks up seamlessly.

### BEADS

Trivial — bead state persists across sessions:

1. User runs `/craft` in a new session
2. Identify the epic (user provides name or check `Skill: beads:list`)
3. Call `Skill: beads:ready` to get the next dispatchable tasks
4. Resume the orchestration loop from Step 2

### NATIVE

Native tasks are session-scoped — they do not persist across Claude Code sessions. If the session ends, progress is lost.

On recovery:

1. User runs `/craft` in a new session
2. Read the session artifact from `.crafter/sessions/` (or the plan file) to reconstruct context
3. Recreate the task list with `TaskCreate` for remaining incomplete work
4. Resume the orchestration loop from Step 2

The session artifact's Execution Log section shows which tasks were completed, allowing accurate reconstruction of remaining work.
