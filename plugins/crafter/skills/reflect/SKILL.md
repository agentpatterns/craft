# Reflect Skill

**Post-session learning loop:** Capture what worked, what caused friction, and embed those insights back into the codebase's context engineering.

## Purpose

After coding sessions, learnings about workflow friction, missing context, and skill gaps evaporate. The Reflect skill closes this loop by:
- Mining git history and artifacts for what actually happened
- Identifying friction points and successful patterns
- Producing concrete improvement proposals for skills, CLAUDE.md, hooks, and templates
- Applying approved improvements with atomic commits

**Output:** Reflection artifact at `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-{topic}-reflection.md`

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- A substantive session just finished (feature, refactor, debugging)
- Workflow friction was noticeable during the session
- A skill felt incomplete or produced unexpected results
- New conventions emerged that should be documented
- CLAUDE.md or hooks need updating based on experience

**Don't use** for:
- Mid-session course corrections (just fix it directly)
- Trivial sessions with no learnings
- Reviewing someone else's work (use code review instead)

## Workflow

### 1. Establish Session Context — BEFORE Plan Mode

If the trigger includes a topic, use it. Otherwise, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask:
- What session or feature did you just finish?
- Which skill(s) did you use (if any)?
- What felt off or notably well?

Derive a reflection slug from the topic (e.g., `auth-feature`, `payment-refactor`).

### 2. Dispatch 4 Parallel Context Agents — BEFORE Plan Mode

**CRITICAL: Dispatch ALL agents in a SINGLE message with `run_in_background: true`.**

Agents need full tool access, so this step MUST happen before plan mode.

See [agent prompts](references/agent-prompts.md) for full templates.

| Agent | Type | What It Reads |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Git Historian | Explore | `git log --oneline -20`, `git diff HEAD~5..HEAD --stat` |
| Artifact Scout | Explore | `docs/plans/` files from last 14 days |
| Context Reader | Explore | `./CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.local.md`, `.claude/settings.json` |
| Skill Inspector | Explore | SKILL.md files for skills used in the session |

#### Agent Dispatch Manifest

The reflection artifact MUST include an **Agent Dispatch Manifest** table documenting the agents dispatched:

```markdown
## Agent Dispatch Manifest
| Agent | Type | Status | Key Finding |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| Git Historian | Explore | completed | {1-line summary} |
| Artifact Scout | Explore | completed | {1-line summary} |
| Context Reader | Explore | completed | {1-line summary} |
| Skill Inspector | Explore | completed | {1-line summary} |
```

This table provides observable evidence of parallel agent dispatch.

#### Git Unavailable Fallback

If git is unavailable (e.g., eval sandbox), include a **Commits (Simulated)** section in the reflection artifact listing the commits that would have been created:

```markdown
## Commits (Simulated)
- `reflect: {description of improvement 1}`
- `reflect: {description of improvement 2}`
```

### 3. Collect Agent Results — BEFORE Plan Mode

- Poll agents with `TaskOutput block: false` to check progress
- Collect completed results with `TaskOutput block: true`
- If an agent returns thin results, note the gap — do NOT dispatch a follow-up

### 4. Enter Plan Mode

Call `EnterPlanMode` — synthesis is a read/write-only activity.

### 5. Synthesize and Write Reflection Artifact — IN Plan Mode

Use the [reflection artifact template](references/template.md) to structure the output.

Cross-reference agent findings to identify:
- **What worked well** — patterns to preserve or document
- **Friction points** — where the session slowed down or went wrong
- **Missing context** — information that should have been in CLAUDE.md or skills
- **Improvement proposals** — concrete changes to make

Categorize each improvement using the taxonomy from the [improvement guide](references/improvement-guide.md).

**Improvement types:**

| Type | Target | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| `skill-update` | A SKILL.md | Add missing anti-pattern to /craft |
| `claude-md` | ./CLAUDE.md or ~/.claude/CLAUDE.local.md | Document new convention |
| `hook` | .claude/settings.json | Add PreToolUse reminder |
| `plan-template` | A references/template.md | Add missing section |
| `new-skill` | New skill directory (sketch only) | Outline a /standup skill |

**Constraints:**
- Cap at **5 proposals max**, priority-ordered
- Each proposal includes: Type, Priority (P1-P3), Target file, Current state (quoted), Proposed change, Rationale

Write the reflection artifact to the plan file.

### 6. Exit Plan Mode — User Reviews

Call `ExitPlanMode` to present the reflection for review.

Then use `AskUserQuestion` to list each proposal with its type and target. Ask the user to pick: **All / None / specific items by number**.

### 7. Apply Approved Improvements

For each approved proposal:
1. Read the target file
2. Apply the change using `Edit` or `Write`
3. Commit with message: `reflect: <description>`

One improvement per commit. Do NOT bundle multiple changes.

### 8. Persist Artifact

Save the reflection artifact:
```
docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-{topic}-reflection.md
```

Commit with: `reflect: add session reflection for {topic}`

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Don't invent problems** — only propose improvements for friction that actually occurred during the session
- **Don't propose more than 5 improvements** — prioritize signal over noise
- **Don't bundle multiple fixes in one commit** — one improvement per commit
- **Don't update `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`** — it's auto-overwritten by tech-pass; use `~/.claude/CLAUDE.local.md`
- **Don't add hooks that already exist** — read `.claude/settings.json` first
- **Don't dispatch agents inside plan mode** — they need full tool access; dispatch before entering plan mode
- **Don't propose sweeping rewrites** — small, targeted improvements compound better

## After Reflect

Once improvements are applied:
1. Review the reflection artifact in `docs/plans/`
2. Verify applied changes with `git log --oneline -5`
3. Consider whether any deferred proposals should become issues or tasks
4. The next session benefits automatically from the updated context
