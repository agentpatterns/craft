# Architecture Decision Records

## Decision Filter

Before writing an ADR, check if the decision qualifies (Harmel-Law signals):

- Requires consulting multiple people to resolve
- Introduces a new technology or changes the tech radar stance
- Conflicts with an existing architectural principle
- Affects more than one team's autonomy

**If unsure:** The template itself is the filter. If you can't fill it in, it's probably not a decision worth recording.

## The Template

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: [Imperative verb phrase]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR-NNNN
**Author:** [Name]

## Context
[2-3 sentences. Forces and constraints. Value-neutral.]

## Decision
[1-2 sentences. Active voice. "We will..."]

## Options Considered
- **Option A** — [one line]
- **Option B** — [one line]

## Consequences
- Good: [positive outcome]
- Bad: [accepted tradeoff]

## Advice
- [Name, Date]: [What they said]
```

## Workflow

1. **Decide if an ADR is needed** — Run through the decision filter above. Skip if no signals match.

2. **Start with a Y-statement** — Forcing function to clarify the decision before writing:
   > "In the context of _____, facing _____, we decided for _____, to achieve _____, accepting _____."
   If you can't complete this sentence, the decision isn't clear enough to record yet.

3. **Create the ADR file** — Naming: `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md` (4-digit zero-padded). Directory: `docs/decisions/`. Check existing files to determine the next number:
   ```
   ls docs/decisions/
   ```

4. **Fill in the template** — Section by section:
   - **Context**: State forces and constraints. Value-neutral tone. Don't justify the decision here.
   - **Decision**: Active voice. "We will use X." Not "X was chosen."
   - **Options Considered**: At least 2 options. Include "do nothing" if applicable. One line each — detail goes in consequences.
   - **Consequences**: Both good and bad for the chosen option. Be honest about tradeoffs.
   - **Advice**: Recommended when multiple stakeholders are affected. Record name, date, and what they said. Advice is not consent — the decision-maker listens, records, and decides.

5. **Finalize** — Set status to `Proposed`. Commit the ADR alongside the code change it documents (same PR). Update status to `Accepted` after review and approval.

## Naming Conventions

- File: `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md` — e.g., `0001-use-postgresql-for-persistence.md`
- Title: Imperative verb phrase — e.g., "Use PostgreSQL for Persistence"
- Directory: `docs/decisions/`

## Status Lifecycle

- **Proposed** → Initial state when ADR is written
- **Accepted** → Approved and in effect
- **Superseded by ADR-NNNN** → Replaced by a newer decision (link to the superseding ADR)

ADRs are immutable once accepted. To change a decision, write a new ADR that supersedes the old one.

## Anti-Patterns

**Retroactive ADRs** — Writing ADRs long after the decision was made. Record decisions when they happen.

**Bikeshedding Status** — Agonizing over Proposed vs Accepted. Start as Proposed, move to Accepted when the team agrees.

**Skipping Options** — Recording only the chosen option. The value is in showing what was considered and why alternatives were rejected.

**Missing Advice Attribution** — "The team agreed" instead of who said what. Name names and dates.

**Over-Scoping** — Trying to capture every technical choice. ADRs are for architecturally significant decisions, not implementation details.

## When NOT to Use

- Trivial decisions with obvious answers
- Decisions already made and shipped long ago (unless capturing for onboarding context)
- Implementation details that don't affect architecture
- Temporary spikes or experiments
